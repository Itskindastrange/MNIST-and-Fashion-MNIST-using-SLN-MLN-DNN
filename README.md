# Deep Learning Models for MNIST and Fashion MNIST

This repository provides Python code to train and evaluate deep learning models on the MNIST and Fashion MNIST datasets using TensorFlow and Keras.

## Overview

- **mnist_fashion_dl_models.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook containing code for data loading, preprocessing, model building, training, evaluation, and prediction.
- **LICENSE**: MIT License file.

## Datasets

- **MNIST Dataset**: Handwritten digits (0-9) images.
- **Fashion MNIST Dataset**: Clothing items images (10 categories).

## Models Implemented

1. **Single Layer Network (SLN)**: Simplest model with one layer.
2. **Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)**: Adds hidden layers for more complex relationships.
3. **Fully Connected Deep Neural Network (DNN)**: Multiple hidden layers for high complexity.

## Usage

1. Install necessary libraries: `tensorflow`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`.
2. Open and run the `mnist_fashion_dl_models.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter environment.
